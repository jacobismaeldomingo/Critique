- [Setting Up Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://git.cs.dal.ca/courses/2025-winter/csci-4176_5708/project-milestone-3/jdomingo
   cd jdomingo

## Running the Application

Because I am using Google Authentication, Expo and other packages/libraries does not support custom native modules, I can only test my code, currently, by running a development build in IOS or Android.

```sh
// Running on IOS
npx expo run:ios

// Running on Android
npx expo run:android
```
